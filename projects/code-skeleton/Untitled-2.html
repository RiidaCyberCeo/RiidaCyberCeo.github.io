    <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement</i><sup>[1]</sup>) is a phenomenon observed in some tree
    species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with
    channel-like gaps.<sup>[2]</sup> The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species,
    but also occurs between trees of different species. There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness
    is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insects.

  <p>
    The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is not certain.<sup>[3]</sup> The phenomenon has been discussed in
    scientific literature since the 1920s.<sup>[4]</sup> The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest
    that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent evolution.<sup>[5]</sup>
