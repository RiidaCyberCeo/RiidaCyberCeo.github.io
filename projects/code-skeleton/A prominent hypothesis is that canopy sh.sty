A prominent hypothesis is that canopy shyness has to do with mutual light sensing by adjacent plants. The photoreceptor-mediated shade avoidance response is a well-documented behavior in a variety of plant species.[15] Neighbor detection is thought to be a function of several unique photoreceptors. Plants can sense the proximity of neighbors by sensing backscattered far-red light, a task widely thought to be accomplished by the activity of the phytochrome photoreceptors.[16] Many species of plant respond to an increase in far-red light (and, by extension, encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away from the far-red stimulus and by increasing the rate of elongation.[17] Similarly, plants use blue light to induce the shade-avoidance response, likely playing a role in the recognition of neighboring plants,[18] though this was just starting to be recognised in 1988.[19]
